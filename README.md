# deboru-colorscheme

It is my colorscheme for Neovim, and it is made with a thought to NOT color every word in the code.

If everything is highlighted — nothing is highlighted.

Everything else you need to know is placed in the deboru.lua.

To install, just place it in your ``` ~/.config/nvim/colors/ ``` and do ``` :colorscheme deboru ```.

You can use my [nvim_poporu](https://github.com/Barysk/nvim) config as a reference.
