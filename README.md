# deboru colorscheme

It is my colorscheme for Neovim, and it is made with a thought to **NOT** color every word in the code.

If **everything** is highlighted - **nothing** is highlighted.

Everything else you need to know is placed in the ``` deboru.lua ```.

To install, just place ``` deboru.lua ``` in your ``` ~/.config/nvim/colors/ ``` and do ``` :colorscheme deboru ```.

You can use my [nvim poporu](https://github.com/Barysk/nvim) config as a reference.
